# DAND_Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data
## Overview
### The objective of this project is to wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The used dataset is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.
### The insights
- The relationship between the favorite tweets and the retweeted tweets reflects that the retweeted tweets are not favorite tweets and vice versa. This relation seems normal because who favorite a tweet not necessarily will retweet the same favorite' tweet.
- The most dogs type in the data frame goes under pupper type, while the least dogs type goes under floofer type.
- The bubble dogs breeds is the dog most favorite on twitter.
